								<span class="image main"><img src="images/pic01.jpg" alt="Waterloo" /></span>
								<p>My passion for programming brought me to the Cheriton School of Computer Science at the University of Waterloo. I am working towards my BCS and am scheduled to complete it in 2025. The branches of data science and machine learning are subfields which are of particular interest to me.</p>
								<p>I continue to develop my programming skills through online coursework, side projects, and hackathons. To see my projects, check out my GitHub profile. I am specifically looking for internships related to computer science; however, I am willing to work flexibly in a different position. I value hard work, equality, and honesty. I like keeping up with the latest news in the world of technology and spending time with family. In the coming years, I hope to develop both as a person and as a working professional in the field of computer science.</p>

								<div>
									<h3>Amazon Customer Reviews Scraper</h3>
									<p>This web scraping project would download amazon reviews using scrapy and its built-in files. To choose which product to download go into reviews.py in spiders and change the values in the list of ASIN numbers to the products you would like to download. Then run the program in the command prompt. The code for the project could be seen on the following GitHub link: <a target="_blank"

								</div>

								<div>
									<h3>Vaccinator</h3>
									<p>I had built a game based on Space Invaders with a Covid-19 spin on it. It was a solo project submitted to Hack-cade, a hackathon hosted by MLH. The project was made using python with the following modules: pygame, os, time, and random. The code could be seen on the following GitHub link: <a href="https://github.com/MuhammadZ985/Covid-19-Game">https://github.com/MuhammadZ985/Covid-19-Game</a></p>
								</div>

								<div>
									<h3>Forex</h3>
									<p>Currency conversion fees are usually considered to be unavoidable. But due to the amount of money exchanged globally between different currencies, traders could easily exchange the money directly between themselves, thus avoiding the conversion fees. This website is where people would post what currencies they have and which ones they desire. Once a match is found they meet up and trade. The code could be seen on the following GitHub link: <a href="https://github.com/MuhammadZ985/Forex">https://github.com/MuhammadZ985/Forex</a></p>
								</div>

								<div>
									<h3>S&P 500 Stocks Visualization System</h3>
									<p>This is a stock visualization system, which creates various graphs based on user input. It can visualize the S&P 500 stocks from 2013-2018 based on a Kaggle data set. This project utilizes the python libraries of pandas and plotly. The code could be seen on the following GitHub link: <a href="https://github.com/MuhammadZ985/S-P500-Stock-Visulaization">https://github.com/MuhammadZ985/S-P500-Stock-Visulaization</a></p>
								</div>

								<div>
									<h3>Weather City</h3>
									<p>WeatherCity is a full-stack web app, it utilizes node.js for its backend along with OpenWeatherMap's API to display the weather in the city inputted in
										the search bar. It also shows the current weather based on location on the home page. The code for the project could be seen on the following GitHub link: <a target="_blank"
										href="https://github.com/MuhammadZ985/WeatherProject">https://github.com/MuhammadZ985/WeatherProject</a></p>
									</div>

								<div>
									<h3>Website Generator</h3>
									<p>This project would produce frontend webpages based on a series of questions and would then return static pages as code in the form of zip files. This would allow for flexibility while offering professional websites for users to utilize. The code could be seen on the following GitHub link: <a href="https://github.com/MuhammadZ985/WebsiteGen">https://github.com/MuhammadZ985/WebsiteGen</a></p>

									<h3>Old Website</h3>
									<p>My old personal website which I had made over the summer. It was a one-page static website that featured my experiences and achievement much like this one does, however, it had a completely different UX/UI design. The code for the project could be seen on the following GitHub link: <a href="https://github.com/MuhammadZ985/Front-End-Personal-Site">https://github.com/MuhammadZ985/Front-End-Personal-Site</a></p>

								<div>
									<h3>Miscellaneous Animations</h3>
									<p>This is just a compilation of some of the animations that I was indenting to add to my website, however, they didn't make it to the final cut. They are attached to my website, with this <span style="font-weight: 600;"><a href="#">link</a></span>, and are uploaded to my GitHub with the following link: <a href="https://github.com/MuhammadZ985/animations">https://github.com/MuhammadZ985/animations</a></p>
								</div>


								<div>
									<h3>Simon Game</h3>
									<p>The Simon game is an online version of the board game Simon. The board is the screen and the 4 colors correspond to the 4 colors in Simon. The objective of this game is to remember the chain of colors that were presented by the game and to input them every time the level changes. The code for the project could be seen on the following GitHub link: <a href="https://github.com/MuhammadZ985/Simon-Game-Challenge">https://github.com/MuhammadZ985/Simon-Game-Challenge</a></p>
								</div>

								<div>
									<h3>Drum Kit</h3>
									<p>Drum kit is an online virtual mimic of a drum set, with different keys corresponding to different types of drums. The buttons may also be clicked using the mouse pad, however, using the keyboard offers a more realistic experience. The code could be seen on the following GitHub link: <a href="https://github.com/MuhammadZ985/Drum-Kit">https://github.com/MuhammadZ985/Drum-Kit</a></p>
								</div>

								<div>
									<h3>Dice Game</h3>
									<p>The dice challenge was one of the first challenges that I had done. The objective was to use basic javascript to create an online simulation of rolling a dice. A single die represents each player, the winner of the game would be the one that rolls the higher number. Refreshing the page would roll the dice again while informing the players of who had won. The code for the project could be seen on the following GitHub link: <a href="https://github.com/MuhammadZ985/Dicee_Challenge">https://github.com/MuhammadZ985/Dicee_Challenge</a></p>
								</div>

								<div>
									<h3>TinDog</h3>
									<p>TinDog is a remix of tinder but for dogs. This website uses Bootstrap, HTML, and CSS to create a single-page static website. The written content of this webpage was provided by a course on Udemy and the challenge was to
										recreate a webpage based on a pdf document that was provided. I have added my spin to the website to make its UI/UX design more pleasant. The website could be seen on the following webpage: <a href="https://muhammadz985.github.io/TinDog/">https://muhammadz985.github.io/TinDog/</a>. The code could be seen on the following GitHub link: <a target="_blank"

								<p>I am actively looking for internships over the summer. I am interested specifically in data science and machine learning roles and I continue to develop these skills through online coursework, side projects, and hackathons (see GitHub for more information). Although internships specifically related to computer science interest me I am willing to work flexibly in a different position. Besides internships I am also open to full-time employment, freelance opportunities, tutoring, volunteer work, working together in hackathons, etc.</p>
